Our music APIs source base on an open source [NeteaseCloudMusicApi](https://binaryify.github.io/NeteaseCloudMusicApi/#/?id=neteasecloudmusicapi).

Our music player base on an open source program [react-jinke-music-player](https://github.com/uniquemo/react-netease-music).

## ⚠ Caption 

We are using [react-jinke-music-player](https://github.com/uniquemo/react-netease-music) as our player, it does not support **playing audio stream file**. Which means we have to accept whole audio stream file and convert to temporary **blob** file then play this **blob** file.

## &#x263a; Management
We use notion to manage teams, assign tasks, and publish useful information. And use wechat, Tencent meeting for discussion every week.During the development process, in order to avoid conflicts, everyone has their own independent branch, which is merged into the dev branch after completing some functions. The dev branch will be merged into the main branch after proper testing.
